# Liara Programming Language

Liara is a personal project. It is a functional dialect of LISP written in Rust. I plan to make various backends for it and expand the interpreter.

This is mostly for research and for personal programming development. The idea is to create a fully usable programming language (with the added simplicity of LISPs easily parsed s-expression syntax).
